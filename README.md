# solana-school-donations
A fully on-chain donation system built with Anchor on Solana, designed to support schools transparently. Donors can contribute using $GET or SOL, while funds are tracked and distributed with full transparency. Schools and communities benefit from a decentralized, trustless, and auditable donation process.
